                <h1>&laquo;Tractor beam&raquo; grabs beads with sound waves</h1>
                <div class="page">
                    <p class="nopadding">
                        En&shy;gi&shy;neers in Bristol have de&shy;ve&shy;loped a system that can grab, hold
                        and move small objects without touching them, using &laquo;holograms&raquo; made of 
                        sound waves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It offers the kind of re&shy;mote cont&shy;rol that na&shy;tu&shy;rally draws 
                        com&shy;pari&shy;son with the &laquo;tractor beams&raquo; of science fiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So far the team has tes&shy;ted the design on small pea-sized objects, which they 
                        can ma&shy;ni&shy;pu&shy;late from 30-40cm away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Writing in Nature Communications, they sug&shy;gest the work could help 
                        de&shy;ve&shy;lop remote sur&shy;gical instru&shy;ments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In essence, an object sit&shy;ting in a &laquo;quiet&raquo; region of space can be 
                        held there if it is sur&shy;rounded by very high-intensity sound waves. As the 
                        pat&shy;tern of that boun&shy;dary shifts, the object can be moved around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The researchers prog&shy;ram&shy;med a grid of small spea&shy;kers to emit 
                        ultra&shy;sound in in&shy;tri&shy;cate, shif&shy;ting pat&shy;terns, craf&shy;ting 
                        shapes from the in&shy;te&shy;rac&shy;ting waves that resem&shy;bled twee&shy;zers, 
                        bot&shy;tles, and tiny tornado-like twis&shy;ters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These &laquo;holograms&raquo; were able to con&shy;trol small beads up to 5mm 
                        across. Crucially, the design works from just one side - in&shy;clu&shy;ding above 
                        or below the beads - in&shy;stead of re&shy;quiring the object to be 
                        sur&shy;rounded by loud&shy;speakers.

                            Prof Bruce Drinkwater from the University of Bristol, one of the study's 
                            authors, said the holy grail in this field is to use this sort of 
                            ma&shy;ni&shy;pu&shy;lation in, for example, tar&shy;geted drug deli&shy;very.

                        &laquo;Our method, we hope, will now be ap&shy;plied, both at a smal&shy;ler 
                        scale - maybe for medical pur&shy;poses - and at a larger scale, poten&shy;tially 
                        for hand&shy;ling dan&shy;gerous materials in some sort of non-contact production 
                        line.&raquo;

                        Similar re&shy;search from the University of Dundee, pub&shy;lished last year, had 
                        already demon&shy;strated that sound waves could tug an object towards a sound 
                        source. Prof Drinkwater said that work was what first ins&shy;pired his own team's 
                        efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &laquo;That was the star&shy;ting point for us thin&shy;king, actually, this could 
                        be pos&shy;sible,&raquo; he told the BBC. &laquo;They showed that the force existed 
                        and they measured it expe&shy;ri&shy;men&shy;tally - but they didn't hold anything 
                        stably.&raquo;

                    <blockquote class="notab">
                        &laquo;Our mission, as it were, was to try and take that and make it into a 
                        stable, working tractor beam, that could actually hold objects and move and 
                        manipulate them&raquo;

                    <p>
                        One of the authors of the 2014 Dundee study, Dr Mike MacDonald, said the work from 
                        Bristol was "a very nice demon&shy;stration" of the power of this tech&shy;nology.

                            The Bristol engi&shy;neers say their tech could even&shy;tually help deliver 
                            drugs in a targeted way.

                        The main dif&shy;ference between their work, he ex&shy;plained, was that 
                        the Bristol team had built their own speaker system from scratch - which made it 
                        very adap&shy;table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &laquo;We used a clini&shy;cally ap&shy;proved device, which was designed for doing 
                        focused ultra&shy;sound surgery. We program&shy;med that to create the same sort of 
                        beams that they did.&raquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &laquo;[But] because they had their own system, it was more program&shy;&shy;mable. 
                        That allowed them to change the beams that they were creating in real time.&raquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &laquo;It is quite dif&shy;ferent from what we did, in that it's moving 
                        indi&shy;vidual par&shy;ticles around and it's recon&shy;figu&shy;rable. But in 
                        other ways, the beams it's producing are not mil&shy;lions of miles away from 
                        what's been done already by others - including us.&raquo;

                            The invi&shy;sible mani&shy;pula&shy;tion of objects cer&shy;tainly sets 
                            imagi&shy;nations racing. When looking for ways to demon&shy;strate what their 
                            con&shy;traption could do, Prof Drinkwater and his col&shy;leagues 
                            under&shy;standably set&shy;tled on a sci-fi analogy.
                        </p>

                        &laquo;We wanted to demon&shy;strate that we could do it up&shy;side down. We had a 
                        dis&shy;cussion and we thought that everyone thinks of a trac&shy;tor beam as 
                        people being sucked up into space.&raquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &laquo;So we mounted the array upside-down in a card&shy;board UFO, and the 
                        particle gets sucked up into it.&raquo;

                        The Dundee researchers, before de&shy;ve&shy;loping their own trac&shy;tor beam in 
                        2014, trod a similar line when they described their ultra&shy;sound device for 
                        pushing and turning as a &laquo;sonic screwdriver&raquo;.
                    </p>

                        Nobody is more aware than engi&shy;neers, it seems, that their research is 
                        in&shy;crea&shy;singly blurring our experience of science fiction and fact.
